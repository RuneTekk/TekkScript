##Stack Structure

The stack is exactly designed to be exactly like the Runescape client script system with a **String** and **Integer** 
stack that is manipulated from an integer Opcode and an operand object. The operand object can be either
a **String** or an **Integer** and respectedly come from their own stack.

##Script Syntax

```
if a do
    #Block
else
end
```
