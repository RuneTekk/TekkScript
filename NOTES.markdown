##Stack Structure

The stack is exactly designed to be exactly like the Runescape client script system with a **String** and **Integer** 
stack that is manipulated from an **Integer Opcode** and an **Operand Object**. The **Operand Object** can be either
a **String** or an **Integer** and respectedly come from their own stack.
